Latest version:

Up to Quest 3 completed, files look very similar to Figma designs.

Both Login and Sign Up buttons on homepage currently link to the NavBar component. 

The Send button on the NavBar links to the Send page, all others link back to Home page (haven't yet created any other pages as this was outside scope of the task and they'd only be blank pages)

Profile/Help icons link to the Profile page.

Would possibly change the structure to make the NavBar and viewing window direct sub-components of another component, and have individual pages load within that, to avoid duplicating navbar code on each page - not making this change yet.

Unsure if the Send button being pink is an intentional way of highlighting it or whether this should indicate that button is being pressed and/or that's the current page the user is on. If the latter, can make changes to show whichever button / section is currently selected as pink. (have already disabled the Send button on the Send page for this reason)

Quest 4 now almost completed, number and delete buttons appear to function correctly after testing. 

Still working on cursor / users being able to edit number by clicking / tapping into a certain point
